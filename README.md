Instructions if you change the Root's directory. 

First. Localize the new route where you want the directory will store.
Secondly. Type the command $ source ./bin/thisroot.sh into the directory that has the Root program.
Third. Type $ cd command to go at your user and type $ gedit .bashrc and go to the end of the sheet and edit putting this text "source /home/dell/Documentos/MIT/Root/root-6.06.00/bin/thisroot.sh" where (in my case) "/home/dell/Documentos/MIT/Root/root-6.06.00/" is the new route than we stored Root. 

 with this we can execute root from our user directory.
